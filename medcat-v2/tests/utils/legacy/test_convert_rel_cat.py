# NOTE: this file is here just to indicate that these tests are in fact run
#       but they're run in:
#       tests.components.addons.relation_extraction.test_rel_cat_in_model_pack
#       that is because they involve downloading a (relatively) large RelCAT model (v1),
#       converting it to v2, adding to a model pack, and subsequently saving it
#       as part of the model pack
