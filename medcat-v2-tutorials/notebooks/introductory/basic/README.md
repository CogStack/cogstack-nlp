# The basic tutorials

The basic tutorials focus on the very base functionality of MedCAT.
That is the Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Entity Linking (EL).
For simplicity sake these tutorials will use the regular expresion (_regex_) based tokenizer.

The idea is that this should get one well versed with how the core MedCAT library works without the need to install many of the optional dependencies that are needed for other parts of it.
