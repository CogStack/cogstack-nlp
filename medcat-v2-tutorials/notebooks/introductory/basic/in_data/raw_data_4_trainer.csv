An abscess, as a morphologic abnormality, refers to a localized collection of
pus within a tissue, organ, or confined space, typically resulting from an
infectious process. It is characterized by necrotic tissue, inflammatory cells,
and bacterial or fungal pathogens, surrounded by a fibrous capsule that forms
as part of the body's response to contain the infection. The presence of an
abscess can alter tissue architecture and may be identified histologically or
through imaging studies.",D0
"
An abscess, as a disorder, is a clinical condition characterized by the
formation of a painful, swollen, and inflamed mass containing purulent
material. It is often accompanied by redness, warmth, and tenderness at the
affected site, and systemic symptoms such as fever may occur in severe cases.
Abscesses can develop in various body regions, including the skin, internal
organs, or deep tissues, and often require drainage, antimicrobial therapy, or
surgical intervention for resolution.",D1
