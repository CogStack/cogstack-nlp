# Meta models allow for additional information

This section focuses on additions to MedCAT that are called MetaCATs.
These are used for meta-annoations.
There's a few tasks that these can be used for, but some of the common onces are:
- `Status` - whether the entity is negated, relevant, or hypothetical
- `Experiences` - whether the entity refers to the patient in question or someone else (e.g spouse, relative)
- `Temporality` - whether the entity refers to something recent, something in the past, or something from the future

The sections here will (hopefully) show you how to add, train, and use MetaCATs for meta-annotations.
